  <h1> What this page strives to do. </h1>
  <p>This page aims to gather information from the user engaging with the page through the use of input prompts which will assign the information to a variable. Having temporarily stored that information, the script on the page will further engage the user by using that information to communicate with the user via alert boxes that concatenate a string and the variable. </p>

  <h2> Getting to know me </h2>
  <p> This page also strives to reveal information about the person behind the page through further use of input prompts, asking yes or no questions, and letting the user know how many questions they got right. </p>

  <h3> About me</h3>
  <p> I don't live in Chicago. I have brown hair. I am not an avid golfer. </p>
